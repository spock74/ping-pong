# Gesture Pong Arcade 🎮

## Overview

Gesture Pong Arcade is a modern take on the classic Pong game, built with a retro-arcade aesthetic. Instead of a mouse or keyboard, you control your paddle in real-time using hand gestures captured through your webcam! The game leverages Google's MediaPipe for cutting-edge hand tracking and the Google Gemini API to generate witty, dynamic taunts and praises from your AI opponent.

## Features ✨

-   **Gesture Control:** Move your paddle up and down using a closed fist or pointing gesture.
-   **Real-time Hand Tracking:** Powered by Google's MediaPipe Hands for low-latency, in-browser gesture recognition.
-   **Dynamic AI Banter:** The computer opponent taunts you when it scores and offers grudging praise when you score, with messages generated by the Google Gemini API.
-   **Game State Control via Gestures:**
    -   **Start Game:** Give a thumbs-up (👍).
    -   **Calibrate:** Make a victory gesture (✌️) from the main menu.
    -   **Pause/Resume:** Show a spread/open hand (🖐️).
    -   **Full Reset:** Give a thumbs-down (👎) to reset the score and return to the main menu.
-   **Adjustable Difficulty:** Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes to match your skill level.
-   **Control Calibration:** A guided calibration sequence allows you to map your personal range of motion for more precise and comfortable control.
-   **Persistent Scoring:** Your overall win/loss record against the AI is saved locally, so you can track your legacy.
-   **Retro Sound & Visuals:** Styled with a glowing, neon arcade look and feel, complete with sound effects for hits, scores, and game events.

## How to Play 🕹️

1.  **Allow Webcam Access:** The game will request permission to use your webcam. This is necessary for gesture detection.
2.  **Choose Your Settings:** On the main menu, you can select your preferred difficulty level and the gesture you want to use for controlling the paddle (Mão Fechada or Apontar).
3.  **Calibrate Controls:** For the best experience, make a **victory (✌️)** gesture to start calibration. Follow the on-screen instructions to aim at the top and bottom targets. This will tailor the paddle movement to your specific hand motions.
4.  **Start the Game:** Make a **thumbs-up (👍)** gesture to begin the match.
5.  **Play!** Move your hand up and down using your selected gesture to control the green paddle.
6.  **First to 5 points wins!**
